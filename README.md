# web accesibility criteria

##  Description :
Accesibilty standards:semantic structure of HTML, logic of the web page, independent logical structure, 

The main objective  of the project is meeting  contemporary standard of web accesibility. The project was made to ensure  given web page with  all nessesary semantic elements to be highly rank by searching engines, to be sure that all elements of the web page are readable and accesible for people with different needs.
During the project I learned main criteria of web accesibility such as proper structure of the web page, presents of reasonable semantic elements,  heading and alt attributes
On the top of that, I learned how to make changes to CSS file ( some classes were changed, some removed and elements added instead,  ) so that the project coud run flowlessly
